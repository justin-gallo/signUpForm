# signUpForm

This is a sample sign-up form to practice intermediate HTML & CSS skills. 

Things I learned: 
    - Sizing elements using viewport width & viewport height
    - Limitations of using viewport units. Some of my element's heights are determined by the viewport's height, which causes the page to break when resizing the window vertically. 
    - Form creation and styling
    - Relative positioning of elements
    - Advanced drop shadow creation
    - Advanced text styling (i.e. letter-spacing)
    - Advanced CSS selectors (i.e. .headerContainer p:last-child)
    - Calculated CSS property values (i.e. font-size: calc(12px + 0.5vw);)
    - Background-image property usage and alignment/scaling methods.
